    "We seek $50,000 in funding to expand GoalPostâ€™s decentralized infrastructure, enabling secure federated discovery across small community instances; to develop privacy-first peer-to-peer resource sharing; and to support training, documentation, and onboarding for grassroots mutual aid groups and worker cooperatives using GoalPost. We are committed to keeping GoalPost open-source, community-co-governed, and relationally stewarded by frontline movements."
